The cryo-pod hisses open and you tumble onto cold metal flooring.

Emergency lighting bathes everything in dim red. Your head pounds. The last
thing you remember is the station alarm blaring — something about a
containment breach in the xenobiology labs.

You are aboard VOID STATION OMEGA, a deep-space research platform at the
edge of known space. The crew is gone. The halls are silent. And something
is very, very wrong.

Your objective: find a way off this station before it's too late.
