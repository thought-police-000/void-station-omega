You came to Dorannia for a routine cargo run — drop off machine parts,
pick up local textiles, jump to the next system. Simple.

It stopped being simple when the customs officials impounded your ship.

"All offworlders must present themselves at the Temple of the Divine
Light," they said, handing you a stamped document. "By order of the
Theocratic Council." They took your ignition key and sent it to the High
Priest as an "offering."

Dorannia is a backwater — low tech, low population, high on religion.
The Temple of the Divine Light controls everything: law, trade, and the
hearts of the faithful. They claim their god performs miracles — healing
the sick, speaking through sacred pools of light. The pilgrims believe
every word.

You're not a pilgrim. You're a free trader who wants her ship back.

But there's something wrong with this place. The "miracles" are too
consistent, too predictable. And in the spacer bar, they whisper about
an offworlder who asked too many questions and was never seen again.

Find your ship key. Find the truth. Get off this rock.
